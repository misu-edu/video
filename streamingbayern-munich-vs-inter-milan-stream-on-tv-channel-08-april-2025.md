Bayern Munich vs Inter Milan live stream: How to watch Champions League clash online and on TV


Things heat up in the quarter final of the Champions League - here's how to tune in
Watch Bayern Munich vs Inter Milan on Tuesday 8 April as the German giants host the Italian league leaders in the first leg of their Champions League quarter final tie.
Bayern Munich are closing in on another Bundelisga title in Germany but would dearly love to get their hands on the Champions League trophy for the first time since 2020. Bayern had to come through a play-off after finishing 12th in the initial league phase, but went on to make light work of home rivals Bayer Leverkusen, 5-0 on aggregate, in the last-16 round.

Inter, meanwhile, went straight through after finishing fourth in the league, before beating Feyenoord home and away, 4-1 on aggregate, to book their own place in the quarter final.
